**Café Website…**

_**About this project:**_

Hey there, just wanted to share this project I've been diving into – my own café website built with PHP. I took the liberty of creating a customized MVC Framework, employing Object-Oriented Programming principles and integrating a MySQL database.

The website encompasses the essential features of a café platform, featuring an admin dashboard tailored for internal navigation by employees. This facilitates CRUD operations, allowing for the management of menus, accounts, and timetables.

What sets the framework apart is its user-friendly URL routing and mapping, designed for smooth testing on a local machine. To run and assess the project locally, I opted for XAMPP on the Windows platform, providing a controlled environment for thorough testing and refinement.
