**Cafe Website
**

This is a personal projetc i've been working on, where i've created a cafe website in the language PHP.
I created my own MVC Framework with OOP Coding and MySQL Database.

This website has a basic layouts of a cafe website with an adminn_dashboard page where employees can access the websites internals:
Do CRUD such as Menu, Accounts, Timetables.

The Framework also includes simple URL Routing and URL Mapping for testing on a localhost machine.

I used XAMPP on windows to run the website locally.
